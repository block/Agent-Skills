# DealMachine

Use DealMachine to turn a user's sales, marketing, lead generation, or real estate research request into a precise property, people, enrichment, comparable-sales, or export workflow.

## Choose the interface

1. Prefer the `dealmachine_*` MCP tools when they are available.
2. Otherwise, use the `dm` CLI if shell access is available.
3. If neither interface is connected, help the user connect the hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.dealmachine.com` or install the CLI with `npm install -g dealmachine`, then run `dm login`.

Never ask the user to paste an API key into chat.

Read [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) when you need the exact MCP Tool ID, CLI command group, or current interface coverage. The reference tracks DealMachine CLI and hosted MCP 0.3.0.

## Protect credits

- Treat filters, fields, locations, usage, identity checks, and count operations as discovery steps.
- Discover valid filter IDs and field IDs before searching. Never invent them.
- Count or estimate the matching audience before a paid search or export.
- Explain the expected result count, fields, contact audience, and credit impact before a large paid operation.
- Ask for confirmation before an export or an operation that can consume a material number of credits.
- For property-only requests, do not add owner or resident contact enrichment.
- For explicit single-record lookups, run the requested lookup and report whether credits were used.

## Plan the request

Identify:

- Entity: property, person, or list
- Location: address, city, county, ZIP code, state, coordinates, or APN
- Criteria: ownership, equity, property characteristics, demographics, or other filters
- Output: count, preview, detailed results, enrichment, comparable sales, list, or export
- Fields: only the data needed for the task
- Contact audience: owners, residents, both, or none
- Limit and format: a small preview first unless the user specifies otherwise

Ask one focused question only when a missing detail would materially change the search or credit cost.

## Use MCP tools

### Discovery

- Use `dealmachine_filters` to find valid property or people filters.
- Use `dealmachine_fields` to find valid output fields.
- Use `dealmachine_location_search` to resolve supported locations.
- Use `dealmachine_usage` before large paid operations.
- Use `dealmachine_whoami` when account context matters.

### Property workflows

- Use `dealmachine_property_count` before a broad search.
- Use `dealmachine_property_search` for a limited result set.
- Use `dealmachine_property_get` or `dealmachine_property_get_many` for known IDs.
- Use `dealmachine_property_export` only after confirming scope and credit impact.
- Use `dealmachine_comps` for comparable sales.

### People workflows

- Use `dealmachine_people_count` before a broad search.
- Use `dealmachine_people_search` for results and the matching get tools for known IDs.
- People search and lookup are available through MCP. Use the CLI for a people export.

### Enrichment

- Use the address, latitude and longitude, or APN enrichment tool for a property.
- Use the email, phone, or name enrichment tool for a person.
- Narrow name searches with a location.

## Use the CLI

Run `dm --help` or a command-specific `--help` when exact syntax is uncertain.

Common patterns:

```bash
dm filters --source-type properties --search "absentee owner" --json
dm fields --source-type properties --search "equity" --json
dm properties count --body-file search.json --json
dm properties search --body-file search.json --json
dm enrich address "123 Main St, Austin, TX" --json
dm enrich phone "5125550100" --json
dm comps PROPERTY_ID --json
dm usage --json
```

Use JSON output for automation. Store complex request bodies in a temporary JSON file instead of constructing fragile shell-escaped payloads.

The CLI also supports saved lists, exports, account activity, address
validation, CRM, tasks, dialer, direct mail, and developer license management.
Use `dm <command> --help` and the command map in
[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) before operating those workflows.

## Present the result

- State what was searched and which filters were applied.
- Distinguish estimates, counts, previews, and complete exports.
- Report records returned and credits used when the response provides those values.
- Show the most decision-useful fields first.
- Preserve uncertainty when a field is missing or inferred.
- Offer the next logical action, such as narrowing the audience, enriching selected records, finding comps, or exporting the confirmed set.

## Boundaries

- Do not claim a phone number, email, valuation, ownership fact, or other attribute that the result does not contain.
- Do not describe a count as a completed export.
- Do not expose access tokens, API keys, or raw credentials.
- Do not bypass DealMachine authentication, plan limits, or credit controls.
